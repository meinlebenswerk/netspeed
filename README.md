# netspeed
A simple monitoring tool, that uses ifconfig stats, to calculate current Network-Interface speeds.
There's probably an easier way to do this, already built in, so this should be seen more like a fun coding exercise ;)

# prerequisites
for Ubuntu install net-tools, for other distros, idk, just google ifconfig ;)

# Usage
just run node monitor.js
